# Python - a literal graphing calculator!

## Python as a calculator.

There are so many things you can do using python. One of the easiest things is to use is as a calculator. Running simple math equations on python is as simple as typing it out because python does all the math for you!

This can be something as simple as adding 2 and 2, but you can do anything from simple addition and subtraction to complex multiplication and divison.

````{python}
2+2
6-5
5-6
157*371
1975/5
````

You can even do longer equations and python will follow PEMDAS rules to solve it!

````{python}
10*(6+7)
````

## Using python to make graphs.

One of my favorite things to do using python is to create graphs. It is as simple as labeling your x and y-axis and python will, again, do all the work for you. What's great is that python and R talk to each other! R comes with so many amazing datasets, and what's cool is you can use those datasets to carry out codes in python!

Let me show you how this works. First you load the dataset in R, I'm using the dataset `college_all_ages` from the `fivethirtyeight` package. This dataset gives information about employment (such as median salary and the employment and unemplyment rate) based on your college major. 

````{R}
library(reticulate)
college_all_ages <- fivethirtyeight::college_all_ages 
data <- as.data.frame(college_all_ages)
head(data)
````

Now I want to create a graph; however, in R the code to create a graph is a little more complex compared to using python. This is why it's great that you can easily switch between the two! 

I'm going to make a scatter plot, since it's easiest to make inferences on relationships using this kind of plot. I want to see if unemployment rate has anything to do with salary, do jobs that can be more easily attained pay less? Doing this is as easy as running `plt.scatter(x-axis variable, y-axis variable).
````{python}

````

So, python is a literal calculator that can also graph (a graphing calculator, if you will). 

Here is a fun meme that I can relate to! I love using R, but python (in my opinion) is a lot more simple and easy to understand! The reason I love this meme is because I was very commited to R when I was first introduced to python, but now I'm team python all the way!

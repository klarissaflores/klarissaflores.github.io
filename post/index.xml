      <description>Falling in love with Python... Python can do some really cool things. R is great, don&#39;t get me wrong, but there is just something about python that actually makes running codes seem simple. For example, one of the easiest things you can do in python is to use it as a calculator. Running simple math equations on python is as simple as typing it out because python does all the math for you!</description>
